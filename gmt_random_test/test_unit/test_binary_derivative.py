    Binary derivative test is one of the tests in GM/T. However, this test is not included in NIST.
    The focus of this test is to check  whether the numbers of 0 and 1 in the nth binary derivation sequence are close to the same. 
    For a binary initial sequence with a length of n, two adjacent bits in the initial sequence are sequentially XORed to obtain
    a binary derivation sequence of the sequence with a length of n-1. By performing the above operations n times in sequence, 
    an n-time binary derivation sequence of the initial sequence can be obtained, with a length of n-k. For a random sequence,
    no matter how many derivations are performed, the number of 0 and 1 should be close to the same.
    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
