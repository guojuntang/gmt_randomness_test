    Discrete Fourier transform (spectral) test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of this test is the peak heights in the Discrete Fourier Transform of the sequence.
    The purpose of this test is to detect periodic features (i.e., repetitive patterns that are near each other) in the
    tested sequence that would indicate a deviation from the assumption of randomness.
    The intention is to detect whether the number of peaks exceeding the 95% threshold is significantly different than 5%.
    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
