    Approximate entropy test as described in NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    As with the Serial test, the focus of this test is the frequency of all possible overlapping m-bit patterns across the entire sequence.
    The purpose of the test is to compare the frequency of overlapping blocks of two consecutive/adjacent lengths (m and m+1) against the
    expected result for a random sequence.
    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
