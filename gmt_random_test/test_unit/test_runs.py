    Runs test is one of the tests in GM/T.
    You can also refer to NIST paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf
    The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence of identical bits.
    A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with a bit of the opposite value.
    The purpose of the runs test is to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected
    for a random sequence. In particular, this test determines whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.
    The significance value of the test is 0.01.
